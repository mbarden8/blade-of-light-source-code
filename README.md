# blade-of-light-source-code
Source code for the game, Blade Of Light, released for free on the iOS App store February 2021.

All assets, (source code, UI, modeling, etc.) were made by @ryan-robinson1 and I. The game is an infinite runner where the player runs towards their enemies,
rather than away from them. Voted "Most Challenging Indie Game of the Year" on r/indiegames, the game has the player take on the role of a cyber ninja/assassin,
as he runs, deflects, and slashes his way through the streets.

All elements of the project not related to source code were removed for this repo in order to prevent people from downloading all the game's files and being able to easily publish it as their own.
